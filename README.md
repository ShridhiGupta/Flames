# FLAMES Game

## Live Demo

```bash
[`https://www.flames-by-shridhi.vercel.app`](https://www.flames-by-shridhi.vercel.app)
```

Interactive FLAMES (Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemies, Siblings) calculator built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI includes an animated galaxy background, glassmorphism input card, real-time loading animation, and celebratory confetti when results are shown.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (for the lightweight static file server).
2. From the project root, start the server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open your browser to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) and load `index.html`.

### Notes

- The command uses Python’s built-in HTTP server; no additional dependencies are required.
- If port `8000` is already taken, change the last number to any free port (e.g., `python -m http.server 8080`) and update the URL accordingly.
